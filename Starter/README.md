# Tip Calculator

Victor is trying to build his tip calculator, using the rules: Tip 15% of the bill if the bill value is between 50 and 300, and if the value is different, the tip is 20%. So here are your tasks:

ðŸš¨ **_Please read the following tasks carefully before starting_** ðŸš¨

- Write a function 'calcTip' that takes any bill value as an input and returns the corresponding tip, calculated based on the rules above.
- Create an array 'bills' containing all 10 test bill values
- Create empty arrays for the tips and the totals ('tips' and 'totals')
- Use the 'calcTip' function you before (no need to repeat) to calculate tips and total values (bill + tip) for every bill value in the bills array. Use a for loop to perform the 10 calculations!
- TEST DATA: 22, 295, 176, 440, 37, 105, 10, 1100, 86 and 52
- BONUS: Write a function 'calcAverage' which takes an array called 'arr' as an argument. This function calculates the average of all numbers in the given array.

ðŸ˜‰ **_HINT: Call calcTip in the loop and use the push method to add values to the tips and totals arrays_** ðŸ˜‰

Use starter code to start the task, and **final code to compare it with your own code whenever something doesn't work**!
